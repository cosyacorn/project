The folder rough work contains all of the directories and versions of the code as I have been working on them. They are all unedited and there are various versions of smilar bits of code in existence.

The folder final version contains the final version of my report (report.pdf). It also contains the final working version of my code (along with a brief guide on running it and the bash script used for queuing a job on lonsdale).

The folder also contains a git repository. Details of all my progress can be viewed by typing git log.
